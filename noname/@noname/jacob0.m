%    J0 = jacob0(rob,q) 
%    J0 = rob.jacob0(q) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables the function 
%    computes the robot jacobian with respect to the base frame. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    q:  6-element vector of generalized coordinates. 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    J0:  [6x6] Jacobian matrix

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
