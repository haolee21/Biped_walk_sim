%% INERTIA_ROW_5 - Computation of the robot specific inertia matrix row for corresponding to joint 5 of 6. 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    Irow = inertia_row_5(rob,q) 
%    Irow = rob.inertia_row_5(q) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables this function computes the 
%    inertia matrix row number 5 of 6 for noname. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of noname specific class 
%    q:  6-element vector of generalized 
%         coordinates 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    Irow:  [1x6] row of the robot inertia matrix

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
   




%    This function was generated by the Symbolic Math Toolbox version 8.5.
