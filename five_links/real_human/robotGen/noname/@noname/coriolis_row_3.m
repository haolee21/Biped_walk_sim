%    rob: robot object of noname specific class 
%    qd:  5-element vector of generalized 
%    q:  5-element vector of generalized 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    Crow:  [1x5] row of the robot Coriolis matrix

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
